Make sure you are remaining consistent with measurement
types (eg pixels, percentages, etc) ...

fix the framing of the gallery thumbnails on the route page

fix the framing of the area pic and quick info pics on the
area page


Look into having images removed when they are changed/deleted


Change the slug field so that it displays the area/route using
string substitution?
